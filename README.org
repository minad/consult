* consult.el - Consulting completing-read
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: consult.el---consulting-completing-read
  :END:

[[https://melpa.org/#/consult][[[https://melpa.org/packages/consult-badge.svg]]]]

This package provides various commands based on the Emacs completion
function =completing-read=, in particular a more advanced buffer
switching command =consult-buffer= which allows to select from buffers,
recent files and more. Furthermore various search commands are provided,
like =consult-grep= and =consult-line=, which resembles
[[https://github.com/abo-abo/swiper#swiper][Swiper]].

The commands are compatible with completion systems based on the
standard Emacs =completing-read= API, notably the default completion
system,
[[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Icomplete.html][Icomplete]],
[[https://github.com/raxod502/selectrum][Selectrum]] and
[[https://github.com/oantolin/embark/][Embark's live-occur]]. If
Icomplete is used, it is recommended to install
[[https://github.com/oantolin/icomplete-vertical][Icomplete-vertical]].
The completion system specifics in this package are kept to a minimum.

There are the [[https://github.com/minad/marginalia/][Marginalia]] and
[[https://github.com/oantolin/embark/][Embark]] packages, which can be
combined with Consult. The =marginalia-mode= enriches the completion
display with annotations. The annotations show for example documentation
strings or file information. Embark provides local actions (like a
context menu), which can be executed while selecting a candidate in the
minibuffer. For example, when selecting a file, an action to delete the
file is offered.

/Note/: If you use [[https://github.com/abo-abo/swiper#ivy][Ivy]] or
[[https://github.com/emacs-helm/helm][Helm]], you probably don't need
Consult, since both packages already bring their own rich set of
additional commands.

** Available commands
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: available-commands
   :END:

Most provided commands follow the naming scheme =consult-<thing>=.

*** Virtual Buffers
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: virtual-buffers
    :END:

- =consult-buffer= (=-other-window=, =-other-frame=): Enhanced version
  of =switch-to-buffer= with support for virtual buffers. Supports live
  preview and recursive editing while previewing. The command supports
  narrowing. You can type =f SPC= in order to narrow to recent files.
  Ephemeral buffers can be shown by pressing =SPC= - it works the same
  way as =switch-buffer=. Supported narrowing keys:

  - b Buffers
  - f Files
  - m Bookmarks
  - p Project (only available if =consult-project-root-function= is
    configured)
  - v Views (only available if =consult-view-*-function=s are
    configured)

- =consult-bookmark=: Select or create bookmark. You might prefer the
  more powerful =consult-buffer= instead, which includes bookmarks.
- =consult-recent-file= (=-other-window=, =-other-frame=): Select a
  recent files. You might prefer the more powerful =consult-buffer=
  instead, which includes recent files.

*** Editing
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: editing
    :END:

- =consult-register=: Select from list of registers.
- =consult-yank=, =consult-yank-pop=: Enhanced version of =yank= and
  =yank-pop= which allows selecting from the kill-ring. Live preview is
  supported when selecting from the kill-ring.
- =consult-kmacro=: Select macro from the macro ring and execute it.

*** Navigation
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: navigation
    :END:

- =consult-goto-line=: Jump to line number enhanced with live preview.
  This is a drop-in replacement for =goto-line=.
- =consult-mark=: Jump to a marker in the =mark-ring=. Supports live
  preview and recursive editing.
- =consult-global-mark=: Jump to a marker in the =global-mark-ring=.
  Supports live preview and recursive editing.
- =consult-outline=: Jump to a heading of the outline. Supports live
  preview and recursive editing.
- =consult-imenu=: Jump to imenu item in the current buffer. Supports
  live preview, recursive editing and narrowing.
- =consult-project-imenu=: Jump to imenu item in project buffers, with
  the same major mode as the current buffer. Supports live preview,
  recursive editing and narrowing. This feature has been inspired by
  [[https://github.com/vspinu/imenu-anywhere][imenu-anywhere]].

*** Search
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: search
    :END:

- =consult-line=: Enter search string and select from matching lines.
  Supports live preview and recursive editing. The symbol at point and
  the recent isearch string are added to the "future history" and can be
  accessed by pressing =M-n=.
- =consult-multi-occur=: Replacement for =multi-occur= which uses
  =completing-read-multiple=.
- =consult-grep=, =consult-ripgrep=, =consult-git-grep=: Search for
  regular expression in current directory. Grep is invoked
  asynchronously, while you enter the search term. You are required to
  enter at least =consult-async-min-input= characters in order for the
  search to get started. The input string is split into two parts, if
  the first character is a punctuation character, like =#=. For example
  ="#grep-regexp#filter-string=, is split at the second =#=. The string
  ="grep-regexp"= is passed to Grep, the ="filter-string"= is passed to
  the /fast/ Emacs filtering to further narrow down the list of matches.
  This is particularily useful if you are using an advanced completion
  style like orderless. =consult-grep= supports preview. If
  =consult-project-root-function= is configured and the function returns
  non-nil, =consult-grep= searches the current project directory.
  Otherwise the =default-directory= is searched. If =consult-grep= is
  invoked with prefix argument, you can specify the directory manually,
  i.e., =C-u M-g r=.
- =consult-find=, =consult-fdfind=, =consult-locate=: Find file by
  matching the path against a regexp. Like =consult-grep= either the
  project root or the current directory is used as root directory for
  the search. The input string is treated similarly to =consult-grep=,
  where the first part is passed to find, and the second part is used
  for Emacs filtering. Note that =find= uses wildcards, e.g. enter
  =*consult*=, to find all files containing the string "consult". In
  contrast, fdfind uses regular expressions.

*** Compilation errors
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: compilation-errors
    :END:

- =consult-error=: Jump to an error. Supports live preview and recursive
  editing. In contrast to =consult-flycheck= it shows the line and is
  more general since it is not tied to a specific backend.
- =consult-flycheck=: Jump to flycheck error. Supports live preview and
  recursive editing. The command supports narrowing. Press =e SPC=,
  =w SPC=, =i SPC= to only show errors, warnings and infos respectively.
  This command requires to install the additional =consult-flycheck.el=
  package since the main =consult.el= package only depends on Emacs core
  components.
- =consult-flymake=: Jump to Flymake diagnostic, like
  =consult-flycheck=.

*** Histories
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: histories
    :END:

- =consult-complex-command=: Select a command from the
  =command-history=. This command is a =completing-read= version of
  =repeat-complex-command= and can also be considered a replacement for
  the =command-history= command from chistory.el.
- =consult-history=: Insert a string from the current buffer history.
  This command can be invoked from the minibuffer. In that case the
  history stored in the minibuffer-history-variable is used.

*** Minor and Major modes
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: minor-and-major-modes
    :END:

- =consult-minor-mode-menu=: Enable/disable minor mode. Supports
  narrowing to on/off/local/global modes by pressing =i/o/l/g SPC=
  respectively.
- =consult-mode-command=: Run a command from the currently active minor
  or major modes. Supports narrowing to local-minor/global-minor/major
  mode via the keys =l/g/m=.

*** Miscellaneous
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: miscellaneous
    :END:

- =consult-apropos=: Replacement for =apropos= with completion.
- =consult-file-externally=: Select a file and open it externally,
  e.g. using =xdg-open= on Linux.
- =consult-completion-in-region=: Function which can be used as
  =completion-in-region-function=. This way, the minibuffer completion
  UI will be used for =completion-at-point=. This function is
  particularily useful in combination with Icomplete-vertical, since
  Icomplete does not provide its own =completion-in-region-function=. In
  contrast, Selectrum already comes with its own function.
- =consult-theme=: Select a theme and disable all currently enabled
  themes. Supports live preview of the theme while scrolling through the
  candidates.

** Live previews
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: live-previews
   :END:

Some Consult commands support live previews. For example when you scroll
through the items of =consult-line=, the buffer will scroll to the
corresponding position. It is possible to jump back and forth between
the minibuffer and the buffer to perform recursive editing while the
search is ongoing. Previews must be explicitly enabled via
=consult-preview-mode=. Furthermore for each command, a customizable
variable is offered to selectively enable/disable preview.

** Narrowing to subsets
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: narrowing-to-subsets
   :END:

Consult has special support to narrow to candidate subsets. When you use
the =consult-buffer= command, you can press =b SPC= and the list of
candidates will be restricted such that only buffers are shown. If you
press =DEL= afterwards, the full candidate list will be shown again.
Furthermore a narrowing/widening key can be configured which can be
pressed to achieve the same effect, see the configuration variables
=consult-narrow-key= and =consult-widen-key=.

** Asynchronous candidates and filtering
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: asynchronous-candidates-and-filtering
   :END:

Consult has support for asynchronous generation of candidate lists. This
feature is used for example by =consult-grep=, where the list of matches
is generated dynamically while the user is typing a grep regular
expression. Furthermore the found matches can then be narrowed using the
installed Emacs completion-style, which can be very powerful if you are
using for example the =orderless= completion style. This is possible
since part of the input string is treated as input to grep and part of
the input is used for filtering. The input string is split at a
punctuation character, using a similar syntax as Perl regular
expressions.

Examples:

- =#defun=: Search for "defun" using grep.
- =#defun#consult=: Search for "defun" using grep, filter with the word
  "consult".
- =/defun/consult=: It is also possible to use other punctuation
  characters.
- =#to#=: Force searching for "to" using grep, since the grep pattern
  must be longer than =consult-async-min-input= characters by default.

** Package configuration
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: package-configuration
   :END:

It is recommended to manage package configurations with =use-package=.
The Consult package only provides commands and does not add any
keybindings. In order to use the enhanced commands, you must configure
the keybindings yourself.

Note that there are three packages as of now: =consult.el=,
=consult-selectrum.el= and =consult-flycheck.el=. Consult has been split
such that the main package =consult.el= only depends on Emacs core
components.

It is recommended to install the following package combination:

- consult: This package
- consult-flycheck: Provides the consult-flycheck command
- consult-selectrum: Provides integration with Selectrum
- selectrum or icomplete-vertical: Vertical completion systems
- marginalia: Annotations for the completion candidates
- embark: Action commands, which can act on the completion candidates
- orderless: Completion style, Flexible candidate filtering
- prescient: Frecency-based candidate sorting, also offers filtering

Note that all packages are independent and can potentially be exchanged
with alternative components, since there exist no hard dependencies.
Furthermore it is possible to get started with only Selectrum and
Consult and add more components later to the mix.
