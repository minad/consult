Consult provides practical commands based on the Emacs completion function
[[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/elisp/Minibuffer-Completion.html][completing-read]]. Completion allows you to quickly select an item from a list of
candidates. Consult offers in particular an advanced buffer switching command
=consult-buffer= to switch between buffers and recently opened files. Furthermore
Consult provides multiple search commands, an asynchronous =consult-grep= and
=consult-ripgrep=, and the line-based search command =consult-line=. Some of the
Consult commands are enhanced versions of built-in Emacs commands. For example
the command =consult-imenu= presents a flat list of the Imenu with [[#live-previews][live preview]],
[[#narrowing-and-grouping][grouping and narrowing]]. Please take a look at the [[#available-commands][full list of commands]].

Consult is fully compatible with completion systems centered around the standard
Emacs =completing-read= API, notably the default completion system, [[https://github.com/minad/vertico][Vertico]], [[https://github.com/protesilaos/mct][Mct]],
and [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Icomplete.html][Icomplete]].

This package keeps the completion system specifics to a minimum. The ability of
the Consult commands to work well with arbitrary completion systems is one of
the main advantages of the package. Consult fits well into existing setups and
it helps you to create a full completion environment out of small and
independent components.

You can combine the complementary packages [[https://github.com/minad/marginalia/][Marginalia]], [[https://github.com/oantolin/embark/][Embark]] and [[https://github.com/oantolin/orderless][Orderless]] with
Consult. Marginalia enriches the completion display with annotations, e.g.,
documentation strings or file information. The versatile Embark package provides
local actions, comparable to a context menu. These actions operate on the
selected candidate in the minibuffer or at point in normal buffers. For example,
when selecting from a list of files, Embark offers an action to delete the file.
Additionally Embark offers a facility to collect completion candidates in a
collect buffer. The section [[#embark-integration][Embark integration]] documents in greater detail how
Consult and Embark work together.

#+cindex: commands

Most Consult commands follow the meaningful naming scheme =consult-<thing>=.
Many commands implement a little known but convenient Emacs feature called
"future history", which guesses what input the user wants. At a command prompt
type =M-n= and typically Consult will insert the symbol or thing at point into
the input.

*TIP:* If you have [[https://github.com/minad/marginalia][Marginalia]] annotators activated, type =M-x ^consult= to see
all Consult commands with their abbreviated description. Alternatively, type
=C-h a ^consult= to get an overview of all Consult variables and functions with
their descriptions.

** Virtual Buffers
:properties:
:description: Buffers, bookmarks and recent files
:end:
#+cindex: virtual buffers

#+findex: consult-buffer
#+findex: consult-buffer-other-window
#+findex: consult-buffer-other-frame
#+findex: consult-project-buffer
#+findex: consult-recent-file
#+findex: consult-bookmark
- =consult-buffer= (=-other-window=, =-other-frame=): Enhanced version
  of =switch-to-buffer= with support for virtual buffers. Supports live preview
  of buffers and narrowing to the virtual buffer types. You can type =f SPC= in
  order to narrow to recent files. Press =SPC= to show ephemeral buffers.
  Supported narrowing keys:
  - b Buffers
  - SPC Hidden buffers
  - * Modified buffers
  - f Files (Requires =recentf-mode=)
  - r File registers
  - m Bookmarks
  - p Project
  - Custom [[#multiple-sources][other sources]] configured in =consult-buffer-sources=.
- =consult-project-buffer=: Variant of =consult-buffer= restricted to buffers and
  recent files of the current project. You can add custom sources to
  =consult-project-buffer-sources=. The command may prompt you for a project if
  you invoke it from outside a project.
- =consult-bookmark=: Select or create bookmark. To select bookmarks you might use the
  =consult-buffer= as an alternative, which can include a bookmark virtual buffer
  source. Note that =consult-bookmark= supports preview of bookmarks and
  narrowing.
- =consult-recent-file=: Select from recent files with preview.
  You might prefer the powerful =consult-buffer= instead, which can include
  recent files as a virtual buffer source. The =recentf-mode= enables tracking of
  recent files.

** Editing
:properties:
:description: Commands useful for editing
:end:
#+cindex: editing

#+findex: consult-yank-pop
#+findex: consult-yank-from-kill-ring
#+findex: consult-yank-replace
#+findex: consult-kmacro
- =consult-yank-from-kill-ring=: Enhanced version of =yank= to select an item
  from the =kill-ring=. The selected text previewed as overlay in the buffer.
- =consult-yank-pop=: Enhanced version of =yank-pop= with DWIM-behavior, which
  either replaces the last =yank= by cycling through the =kill-ring=, or if there
  has not been a last =yank= consults the =kill-ring=. The selected text previewed
  as overlay in the buffer.
- =consult-yank-replace=: Like =consult-yank-pop=, but always replaces the last
  =yank= with an item from the =kill-ring=.
- =consult-kmacro=: Select macro from the macro ring and execute it.

** Register
:properties:
:description: Searching through registers and fast access
:end:
#+cindex: register

#+findex: consult-register
#+findex: consult-register-load
#+findex: consult-register-store
#+findex: consult-register-format
#+findex: consult-register-window
- =consult-register=: Select from list of registers. The command
  supports narrowing to register types and preview of marker positions. This
  command is useful to search the register contents. For quick access use the
  commands =consult-register-load=, =consult-register-store= or the built-in Emacs
  register commands.
- =consult-register-format=: Set =register-preview-function= to this function for
  an enhanced register formatting. See the [[#use-package-example][example configuration]].
- =consult-register-window=: Replace =register-preview= with this function for a
  better register window. See the [[#use-package-example][example configuration]].
- =consult-register-load=: Utility command to quickly load a register.
  The command either jumps to the register value or inserts it.
- =consult-register-store=: Improved UI to store registers depending on the current
  context with an action menu. With an active region, store/append/prepend the
  contents, optionally deleting the region when a prefix argument is given.
  With a numeric prefix argument, store/add the number. Otherwise store point,
  frameset, window or kmacro. Usage examples:
  * =M-' x=: If no region is active, store point in register =x=.
    If a region is active, store the region in register =x=.
  * =M-' M-w x=: Store window configuration in register =x=.
  * =C-u 100 M-' x=: Store number in register =x=.

** Navigation
:properties:
:description: Mark rings, outlines and imenu
:end:
#+cindex: navigation

#+findex: consult-goto-line
#+findex: consult-mark
#+findex: consult-global-mark
#+findex: consult-outline
#+findex: consult-imenu
#+findex: consult-imenu-multi
- =consult-goto-line=: Jump to line number enhanced with live preview.
  This is a drop-in replacement for =goto-line=.
- =consult-mark=: Jump to a marker in the =mark-ring=. Supports live
  preview and recursive editing.
- =consult-global-mark=: Jump to a marker in the =global-mark-ring=.
  Supports live preview and recursive editing.
- =consult-outline=: Jump to a heading of the outline. Supports narrowing
  to a heading level, live preview and recursive editing.
- =consult-imenu=: Jump to imenu item in the current buffer. Supports
  live preview, recursive editing and narrowing.
- =consult-imenu-multi=: Jump to imenu item in project buffers, with
  the same major mode as the current buffer. Supports live preview,
  recursive editing and narrowing. This feature has been inspired by
  [[https://github.com/vspinu/imenu-anywhere][imenu-anywhere]].

** Search
:properties:
:description: Line search, grep and file search
:end:
#+cindex: search

#+findex: consult-line
#+findex: consult-line-multi
#+findex: consult-multi-occur
#+findex: consult-keep-lines
#+findex: consult-focus-lines
- =consult-line=: Enter search string and select from matching lines.
  Supports live preview and recursive editing. The symbol at point and the
  recent Isearch string are added to the "future history" and can be accessed
  by pressing =M-n=. When =consult-line= is bound to the =isearch-mode-map= and
  is invoked during a running Isearch, it will use the current Isearch string.
- =consult-line-multi=: Search across multiple buffers. By default search across
  project buffers. If invoked with a prefix argument search across all buffers.
  Behaves like =consult-line=.
- =consult-multi-occur=: Replacement for =multi-occur= which uses
  =completing-read-multiple=.
- =consult-keep-lines=: Replacement for =keep/flush-lines= which uses the current
  completion style for filtering the buffer. The function updates the buffer
  while typing. In particular =consult-keep-lines= can narrow down an exported
  Embark collect buffer further, relying on the same completion filtering as
  ~completing-read~. If the input begins with the negation operator, i.e., ~! SPC~,
  the filter matches the complement. If a region is active, the region restricts
  the filtering.
- =consult-focus-lines=: Temporarily hide lines by filtering them using the
  current completion style. Call with =C-u= prefix argument in order to show the
  hidden lines again. If the input begins with the negation operator, i.e., ~!
  SPC~, the filter matches the complement. In contrast to =consult-keep-lines= this
  function does not edit the buffer. If a region is active, the region restricts
  the filtering.

** Grep and Find
:properties:
:description: Searching through the filesystem
:end:
#+cindex: grep
#+cindex: find
#+cindex: locate

#+findex: consult-grep
#+findex: consult-ripgrep
#+findex: consult-git-grep
#+findex: consult-find
#+findex: consult-locate
- =consult-grep=, =consult-ripgrep=, =consult-git-grep=: Search for regular expression
  in files. Consult invokes Grep asynchronously, while you enter the search
  term. After at least =consult-async-min-input= characters, the search gets
  started. Consult splits the input string into two parts, if the first
  character is a punctuation character, like =#=. For example
  =#regexps#filter-string=, is split at the second =#=. The string =regexps= is
  passed to Grep. Note that Consult transforms Emacs regular expressions to
  expressions understand by the search program. Always use Emacs regular
  expressions at the prompt. If you enter multiple regular expressions
  separated by space only lines matching all regular expressions are shown. In
  order to match space literally, escape the space with a backslash. The
  =filter-string= is passed to the /fast/ Emacs filtering to further narrow down
  the list of matches. This is particularly useful if you are using an advanced
  completion style like orderless. =consult-grep= supports preview. If the
  =consult-project-function= returns non-nil, =consult-grep= searches the
  current project directory. Otherwise the =default-directory= is searched. If
  =consult-grep= is invoked with prefix argument =C-u M-s g=, you can specify the
  directory manually.
- =consult-find=, =consult-locate=: Find file by matching the path against a regexp.
  Like for =consult-grep=, either the project root or the current directory is the
  root directory for the search. The input string is treated similarly to
  =consult-grep=, where the first part is passed to find, and the second part is
  used for Emacs filtering.

** Compilation
:properties:
:description: Jumping to references and compilation errors
:end:
#+cindex: compilation errors

#+findex: consult-compile-error
#+findex: consult-flymake
#+findex: consult-xref
- =consult-compile-error=: Jump to a compilation error. Supports live preview
  narrowing and recursive editing.
- =consult-flymake=: Jump to flymake diagnostic. Supports live preview and
  recursive editing. The command supports narrowing. Press =e SPC=, =w SPC=, =n SPC=
  to only show errors, warnings and notes respectively.
- =consult-xref=: Integration with xref. This function can be set as
  =xref-show-xrefs-function= and =xref-show-definitions-function=.

** Histories
:properties:
:description: Navigating histories
:end:
#+cindex: history

#+findex: consult-complex-command
#+findex: consult-history
#+findex: consult-isearch-history
- =consult-complex-command=: Select a command from the
  =command-history=. This command is a =completing-read= version of
  =repeat-complex-command= and is also a replacement for the =command-history=
  command from chistory.el.
- =consult-history=: Insert a string from the current buffer history, for example
  the Eshell or Comint history. You can also invoke this command from the
  minibuffer. In that case =consult-history= uses the history stored in the
  =minibuffer-history-variable=. If you prefer =completion-at-point=, take a look at
  =cape-history= from the [[https://github.com/minad/cape][Cape]] package.
- =consult-isearch-history=: During an Isearch session, this command picks a
  search string from history and continues the search with the newly selected
  string. Outside of Isearch, the command allows you to pick a string from the
  history and starts a new Isearch. =consult-isearch-history= acts as a drop-in
  replacement for =isearch-edit-string=.

** Modes
:properties:
:description: Toggling minor modes and executing commands
:end:
#+cindex: minor mode
#+cindex: major mode

#+findex: consult-minor-mode-menu
#+findex: consult-mode-command
- =consult-minor-mode-menu=: Enable/disable minor mode. Supports
  narrowing to on/off/local/global modes by pressing =i/o/l/g SPC=
  respectively.
- =consult-mode-command=: Run a command from the currently active minor or major
  modes. Supports narrowing to local-minor/global-minor/major mode via the keys
  =l/g/m=.

** Org Mode
:properties:
:description: Org-specific commands
:end:

#+findex: consult-org-heading
#+findex: consult-org-agenda
- =consult-org-heading=: Similar to =consult-outline=, for Org
  buffers. Supports narrowing by heading level, priority and TODO
  state, as well as live preview and recursive editing.
- =consult-org-agenda=: Jump to an agenda heading. Supports
  narrowing by heading level, priority and TODO state, as well as
  live preview and recursive editing.

** Miscellaneous
:properties:
:description: Various other useful commands
:end:

#+findex: consult-apropos
#+findex: consult-file-externally
#+findex: consult-completion-in-region
#+findex: consult-theme
#+findex: consult-man
#+findex: consult-preview-at-point
#+findex: consult-preview-at-point-mode
- =consult-apropos=: Replacement for =apropos= with completion. As a better
  alternative, you can run =embark-export= from commands like =M-x= or
  =describe-symbol=.
- =consult-man=: Find Unix man page, via Unix =apropos= or =man -k=. =consult-man= opens
  the selected man page using the Emacs =man= command.
- =consult-file-externally=: Select a file and open it externally, e.g. using
  =xdg-open= on Linux.
- =consult-theme=: Select a theme and disable all currently enabled themes.
  Supports live preview of the theme while scrolling through the candidates.
- =consult-preview-at-point= and =consult-preview-at-point-mode=: Command and minor
  mode which previews the candidate at point in the =*Completions*= buffer. This
  mode is relevant if you use [[https://git.sr.ht/~protesilaos/mct][Mct]] or the default =*Completions*= UI.
- =consult-completion-in-region=: In case you don't use [[https://github.com/minad/corfu][Corfu]] as your in-buffer
  completion UI, this function can be set as =completion-in-region-function=. Then
  your minibuffer completion UI (e.g., Vertico or Icomplete) will be used for
  =completion-at-point=. If you use Mct, you can give =mct-region-mode= a try.
  #+begin_src emacs-lisp
    ;; Use `consult-completion-in-region' if Vertico is enabled.
    ;; Otherwise use the default `completion--in-region' function.
    (setq completion-in-region-function
          (lambda (&rest args)
            (apply (if vertico-mode
                       #'consult-completion-in-region
                     #'completion--in-region)
                   args)))
  #+end_src
  Instead of =consult-completion-in-region=, you may prefer to see the
  completions directly in the buffer as a small popup. In that case, I recommend
  either the [[https://github.com/minad/corfu][Corfu]] or the [[https://github.com/company-mode/company-mode][Company]] package. There is a technical limitation of
  =consult-completion-in-region= in combination with Lsp-mode or Eglot. The Lsp
  server relies on the input at point, in order to generate refined candidate
  strings. Since the completion is transferred from the original buffer to the
  minibuffer, the server does not receive the updated input. LSP completion
  works with Corfu or Company though, which perform the completion directly in
  the original buffer.

* Special features
:properties:
:description: Enhancements over built-in `completing-read'
:end:

Consult enhances =completing-read= with live previews of candidates, additional
narrowing capabilities to candidate groups and asynchronously generated
candidate lists. The internal =consult--read= function, which is used by most
Consult commands, is a thin wrapper around =completing-read= and provides the
special functionality. In order to support multiple candidate sources there
exists the high-level function =consult--multi=. The architecture of Consult
allows it to work with different completion systems in the backend, while still
offering advanced features.

** Live previews
:properties:
:description: Preview the currently selected candidate
:custom_id: live-previews
:end:
#+cindex: preview

Some Consult commands support live previews. For example when you scroll through
the items of =consult-line=, the buffer will scroll to the corresponding position.
It is possible to jump back and forth between the minibuffer and the buffer to
perform recursive editing while the search is ongoing.

Consult enables previews by default. You can disable them by adjusting the
=consult-preview-key= variable. Furthermore it is possible to specify keybindings
which trigger the preview manually as shown in the [[#use-package-example][example configuration]]. The
default setting of =consult-preview-key= is =any= which means that Consult triggers
the preview /immediately/ on any key press when the selected candidate changes.
You can configure each command individually with its own =:preview-key=. The
following settings are possible:

- Automatic and immediate ='any=
- Automatic and delayed =(list :debounce 0.5 'any)=
- Manual and immediate =(kbd "M-.")=
- Manual and delayed =(list :debounce 0.5 (kbd "M-."))=
- Disabled =nil=

A safe recommendation is to leave automatic immediate previews enabled in
general and disable the automatic preview only for commands where the preview
may be expensive due to file loading. Internally, Consult uses the
value of =this-command= to determine the =:preview-key=
customized. This means that if you wrap a =consult-*= command within
your own function or command, you will also need to add the name of
/your custom command/ to the =consult-customize= call in order for it
to be considered.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (consult-customize
   consult-ripgrep consult-git-grep consult-grep
   consult-bookmark consult-recent-file consult-xref
   consult--source-bookmark consult--source-file-register
   consult--source-recent-file consult--source-project-recent-file
   ;; my/command-wrapping-consult    ;; disable auto previews inside my command
   :preview-key '(:debounce 0.4 any) ;; Option 1: Delay preview
   ;; :preview-key (kbd "M-."))      ;; Option 2: Manual preview
#+end_src

In this case one may wonder what the difference is between using an Embark
action on the current candidate in comparison to a manually triggered preview.
The main difference is that the files opened by manual preview are closed again
after the completion session. Furthermore during preview some functionality is
disabled to improve the performance, see for example the customization variables
=consult-preview-allowed-hooks= and =consult-preview-variables=. Files larger than
=consult-preview-raw-size= are previewed literally without syntax highlighting and
without changing the major mode. Delaying the preview is also useful for
=consult-theme=, since the theme preview is slow. The delay results in a smoother
UI experience.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  ;; Preview on any key press, but delay 0.5s
  (consult-customize consult-theme :preview-key '(:debounce 0.5 any))
  ;; Preview immediately on M-., on up/down after 0.5s, on any other key after 1s
  (consult-customize consult-theme
                     :preview-key
                     (list (kbd "M-.")
                           :debounce 0.5 (kbd "<up>") (kbd "<down>")
                           :debounce 1 'any))
#+end_src

** Narrowing and grouping
:properties:
:description: Restricting the completion to a candidate group
:custom_id: narrowing-and-grouping
:end:
#+cindex: narrowing

Consult has special support for candidate groups. If the completion UI supports
the grouping functionality, the UI separates the groups with thin lines and
shows group titles. Grouping is useful if the list of candidates consists of
candidates of multiple types or candidates from [[#multiple-sources][multiple sources]], like the
=consult-buffer= command, which shows both buffers and recently opened files. Note
that you can disable the group titles by setting the =:group= property of the
corresponding command to nil using the =consult-customize= macro.

By entering a narrowing prefix or by pressing a narrowing key it is possible to
restrict the completion candidates to a certain candidate group. When you use
the =consult-buffer= command, you can enter the prefix =b SPC= to restrict list of
candidates to buffers only. If you press =DEL= afterwards, the full candidate list
will be shown again. Furthermore a narrowing prefix key and a widening key can
be configured which can be pressed to achieve the same effect, see the
configuration variables =consult-narrow-key= and =consult-widen-key=.

After pressing =consult-narrow-key=, the possible narrowing keys can be shown by
pressing =C-h=. When pressing =C-h= after some prefix key, the =prefix-help-command=
is invoked, which shows the keybinding help window by default. As a more compact
alternative, there is the =consult-narrow-help= command which can be bound to a
key, for example =?= or =C-h= in the =consult-narrow-map=, as shown in the [[#use-package-example][example
configuration]]. If [[https://github.com/justbur/emacs-which-key][which-key]] is installed, the narrowing keys are automatically
shown in the which-key window after pressing the =consult-narrow-key=.

** Asynchronous search
:properties:
:description: Filtering asynchronously generated candidate lists
:end:
#+cindex: asynchronous search

Consult has support for asynchronous generation of candidate lists. This feature
is used for search commands like =consult-grep=, where the list of matches is
generated dynamically while the user is typing a regular expression. The grep
process is executed in the background. When modifying the regular expression,
the background process is terminated and a new process is started with the
modified regular expression.

The matches, which have been found, can then be narrowed using the installed
Emacs completion-style. This can be powerful if you are using for example the
=orderless= completion style.

This two-level filtering is possible by splitting the input string. Part of the
input string is treated as input to grep and part of the input is used for
filtering. There are multiple splitting styles available, configured in
~consult-async-split-styles-alist~: =nil=, =comma=, =semicolon= and =perl=. The default
splitting style is configured with the variable ~consult-async-split-style~.

With the =comma= and =semicolon= splitting styles, the first word before the comma
or semicolon is passed to grep, the remaining string is used for filtering. The
=nil= splitting style does not perform any splitting, the whole input is passed to
grep.

The =perl= splitting style splits the input string at a punctuation character,
using a similar syntax as Perl regular expressions.

Examples:

- =#defun=: Search for "defun" using grep.
- =#consult embark=: Search for both "consult" and "embark" using grep in any order.
- =#first.*second=: Search for "first" followed by "second" using grep.
- =#\(consult\|embark\)=: Search for "consult" or "embark" using grep. Note the
  usage of Emacs-style regular expressions.
- =#defun#consult=: Search for "defun" using grep, filter with the word
  "consult".
- =/defun/consult=: It is also possible to use other punctuation
  characters.
- =#to#=: Force searching for "to" using grep, since the grep pattern
  must be longer than =consult-async-min-input= characters by default.
- =#defun -- --invert-match#=: Pass argument =--invert-match= to grep.

Asynchronous processes like =find= and =grep= create an error log buffer
=_*consult-async*= (note the leading space), which is useful for
troubleshooting. The prompt has a small indicator showing the process status:

- =:= the usual prompt colon, before input is provided.
- =*= with warning face, the process is running.
- =:= with success face, success, process exited with an error code of zero.
- =!= with error face, failure, process exited with a nonzero error code.
- =;= with error face, interrupted, for example if more input is provided.

** Multiple sources
:properties:
:description: Combining candidates from different sources
:custom_id: multiple-sources
:end:
#+cindex: multiple sources

Multiple synchronous candidate sources can be combined. This feature is used by
the =consult-buffer= command to present buffer-like candidates in a single menu
for quick access. By default =consult-buffer= includes buffers, bookmarks, recent
files and project-specific buffers and files. It is possible to configure the
list of sources via the =consult-buffer-sources= variable. Arbitrary custom
sources can be defined.

As an example, the bookmark source is defined as follows:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(defvar consult--source-bookmark
  `(:name     "Bookmark"
    :narrow   ?m
    :category bookmark
    :face     consult-bookmark
    :history  bookmark-history
    :items    ,#'bookmark-all-names
    :action   ,#'consult--bookmark-action))
#+end_src

Required source fields:
- =:category= Completion category.
- =:items= List of strings to select from or function returning list of strings.
  A list of cons cells is not supported.

Optional source fields:
- =:name= Name of the source, used for narrowing, group titles and annotations.
- =:narrow= Narrowing character or =(character . string)= pair.
- =:preview-key= Preview key or keys which trigger preview.
- =:enabled= Function which must return t if the source is enabled.
- =:hidden= When t candidates of this source are hidden by default.
- =:face= Face used for highlighting the candidates.
- =:annotate= Annotation function called for each candidate, returns string.
- =:history= Name of history variable to add selected candidate.
- =:default= Must be t if the first item of the source is the default value.
- =:action= Function called with the selected candidate.
- =:new= Function called with new candidate name, only if =:require-match= is nil.
- =:state= State constructor for the source, must return the state function.
- Other source fields can be added specifically to the use case.

The =:state= and =:action= fields of the sources deserve a longer explanation. The
=:action= function takes a single argument and is only called after selection with
the selected candidate, if the selection has not been aborted. This
functionality is provided for convenience and easy definition of sources. The
=:state= field is more general. The =:state= function is a constructor function
without arguments, which can perform some setup necessary for the preview. It
must return a closure which takes an ACTION and a CANDIDATE argument. See the
docstring of =consult--with-preview= for more details about the ACTION argument.

By default, =consult-buffer= previews buffers, bookmarks and files. Loading recent
files or bookmarks can result in expensive operations. However it is possible to
configure a manual preview as follows.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (consult-customize
   consult--source-bookmark consult--source-file-register
   consult--source-recent-file consult--source-project-recent-file
   :preview-key (kbd "M-."))
#+end_src

Sources can be added directly to the =consult-buffer-source= list for convenience.
For example views/perspectives can be added to the list of virtual buffers from
a library like [[https://github.com/minad/bookmark-view/][bookmark-view]].

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
;; Configure new bookmark-view source
(add-to-list 'consult-buffer-sources
              (list :name     "View"
                    :narrow   ?v
                    :category 'bookmark
                    :face     'font-lock-keyword-face
                    :history  'bookmark-view-history
                    :action   #'consult--bookmark-action
                    :items    #'bookmark-view-names)
              'append)

;; Modify bookmark source, such that views are hidden
(setq consult--source-bookmark
      (plist-put
       consult--source-bookmark :items
       (lambda ()
         (bookmark-maybe-load-default-file)
         (mapcar #'car
                 (seq-remove (lambda (x)
                               (eq #'bookmark-view-handler
                                   (alist-get 'handler (cdr x))))
                             bookmark-alist)))))
#+end_src

Another useful source lists all Org buffers and lets you create new ones. One
can create similar sources for other major modes, e.g., for Eshell.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (defvar org-source
    (list :name     "Org Buffer"
          :category 'buffer
          :narrow   ?o
          :face     'consult-buffer
          :history  'buffer-name-history
          :state    #'consult--buffer-state
          :new
          (lambda (name)
            (with-current-buffer (get-buffer-create name)
              (insert "#+title: " name "\n\n")
              (org-mode)
              (consult--buffer-action (current-buffer))))
          :items
          (lambda ()
            (mapcar #'buffer-name
                    (seq-filter
                     (lambda (x)
                       (eq (buffer-local-value 'major-mode x) 'org-mode))
                     (buffer-list))))))

  (add-to-list 'consult-buffer-sources 'org-source 'append)
#+end_src

For more details, see the documentation of =consult-buffer= and of the
internal =consult--multi= API. The =consult--multi= function can be used to
create new multi-source commands, but is part of the internal API as of now,
since some details may still change.

** Embark integration
:properties:
:description: Actions, Grep/Occur-buffer export
:custom_id: embark-integration
:end:
#+cindex: embark

*NOTE*: Install the =embark-consult= package from MELPA, which provides
Consult-specific Embark actions and the Occur buffer export.

Embark is a versatile package which offers context dependent actions, comparable
to a context menu. See the [[https://github.com/oantolin/embark][Embark manual]] for an extensive description of its
capabilities.

Actions are commands which can operate on the currently selected candidate (or
target in Embark terminology). When completing files, for example the
=delete-file= command is offered. With Embark you can execute arbitrary commands
on the currently selected candidate via =M-x=.

Furthermore Embark provides the =embark-collect= command, which collects
candidates and presents them in an Embark collect buffer, where further actions
can be applied to them. A related feature is the =embark-export= command, which
exports candidate lists to a buffer of a special type. For example in the case
of file completion, a Dired buffer is opened.

In the context of Consult, particularly exciting is the possibility to export
the matching lines from =consult-line=, =consult-outline=, =consult-mark= and
=consult-global-mark=. The matching lines are exported to an Occur buffer where
they can be edited via the =occur-edit-mode= (press key =e=). Similarly, Embark
supports exporting the matches found by =consult-grep=, =consult-ripgrep= and
=consult-git-grep= to a Grep buffer, where the matches across files can be edited,
if the [[https://github.com/mhayashi1120/Emacs-wgrep][wgrep]] package is installed. These three workflows are symmetric.

+ =consult-line= -> =embark-export= to =occur-mode= buffer -> =occur-edit-mode= for editing of matches in buffer.
+ =consult-grep= -> =embark-export= to =grep-mode= buffer -> =wgrep= for editing of all matches.
+ =consult-find= -> =embark-export= to =dired-mode= buffer -> =wdired-change-to-wdired-mode= for editing.

* Configuration
:properties:
:description: Example configuration and customization variables
:end:

Consult can be installed from [[https://elpa.gnu.org/packages/consult.html][ELPA]] or [[https://melpa.org/#/consult][MELPA]] via the Emacs built-in package
manager. Alternatively it can be directly installed from the development
repository via other non-standard package managers.

There is the [[https://github.com/minad/consult/wiki][Consult wiki]], where additional configuration examples can be
contributed.

*IMPORTANT:* It is strongly recommended that you enable [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/elisp/Lexical-Binding.html][lexical binding]] in your
configuration. Consult relies on lambdas and lexical closures. For this reason
many Consult-related snippets require lexical binding.

** Use-package example
:properties:
:description: Configuration example based on use-package
:custom_id: use-package-example
:end:
#+cindex: use-package

The Consult package only provides commands and does not add any keybindings or
modes. Therefore the package is non-intrusive but requires a little setup
effort. In order to use the Consult commands, it is advised to add keybindings
for commands which are accessed often. Rarely used commands can be invoked via
=M-x=. Feel free to only bind the commands you consider useful to your workflow.
The configuration shown here relies on the =use-package= macro, which is a
convenient tool to manage package configurations.

*NOTE:* There is the [[https://github.com/minad/consult/wiki][Consult wiki]], where you can contribute additional
configuration examples.

** Fine-tuning of individual commands
:properties:
:alt_title: Fine-tuning
:description: Fine-grained configuration for special requirements
:end:

*NOTE:* Consult supports fine-grained customization of individual commands. This
configuration feature exists for experienced users with special requirements.
There is the [[https://github.com/minad/consult/wiki][Consult wiki]], where we collect further configuration examples.

Commands and buffer sources allow flexible, individual customization by using
the =consult-customize= macro. You can override any option passed to the internal
=consult--read= API. The [[https://github.com/minad/consult/wiki][Consult wiki]] already contains a numerous useful
configuration examples. Note that since =consult--read= is part of the internal
API, options could be removed, replaced or renamed in future versions of the
package.

Useful options are:
- =:prompt= set the prompt string
- =:preview-key= set the preview key, default is =consult-preview-key=
- =:initial= set the initial input
- =:default= set the default value
- =:history= set the history variable symbol
- =:add-history= add items to the future history, for example symbol at point
- =:sort= enable or disable sorting
- =:group= set to nil to disable candidate grouping and titles.
- =:inherit-input-method= set to non-nil to inherit the input method.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (consult-customize
   ;; Disable preview for `consult-theme' completely.
   consult-theme :preview-key nil
   ;; Set preview for `consult-buffer' to key `M-.'
   consult-buffer :preview-key (kbd "M-.")
   ;; For `consult-line' change the prompt and specify multiple preview
   ;; keybindings. Note that you should bind <S-up> and <S-down> in the
   ;; `minibuffer-local-completion-map' or `vertico-map' to the commands which
   ;; select the previous or next candidate.
   consult-line :prompt "Search: "
   :preview-key (list (kbd "<S-down>") (kbd "<S-up>")))
#+end_src

The configuration values are evaluated at runtime, just before the completion
session is started. Therefore you can use for example =thing-at-point= to adjust
the initial input or the future history.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (consult-customize
   consult-line
   :add-history (seq-some #'thing-at-point '(region symbol)))

  (defalias 'consult-line-thing-at-point 'consult-line)

  (consult-customize
   consult-line-thing-at-point
   :initial (thing-at-point 'symbol))
#+end_src

Generally it is possible to modify commands for your individual needs by the
following techniques:

1. Use =consult-customize= in order to change the command or source settings.
2. Create your own wrapper function which passes modified arguments to the Consult functions.
3. Create your own buffer [[#multiple-sources][multi sources]] for =consult-buffer=.
4. Create advices to modify some internal behavior.
5. Write or propose a patch.

Not directly related to Consult, but maybe still of interest are the following
packages. These packages should work well with Consult, follow a similar spirit or
offer functionality based on ~completing-read~.

- [[https://github.com/minad/corfu][corfu]]: Completion systems for =completion-at-point= using small popups (Alternative to [[https://github.com/company-mode/company-mode][Company]]).
- [[https://github.com/minad/cape][cape]]: Completion At Point Extensions, which can be used with =consult-completion-in-region= and [[https://github.com/minad/corfu][Corfu]].
- [[https://github.com/minad/bookmark-view][bookmark-view]]: Store window configuration as bookmarks, possible integration with =consult-buffer=.
- [[https://github.com/bdarcus/citar][citar]]: Versatile package for citation insertion and bibliography management.
- [[https://github.com/astoff/devdocs.el][devdocs]]: Emacs viewer for [[https://devdocs.io/][DevDocs]] with a convenient completion interface.
- [[https://github.com/d12frosted/flyspell-correct][flyspell-correct]]: Apply spelling corrections by selecting via =completing-read=.
- [[https://github.com/mhayashi1120/Emacs-wgrep][wgrep]]: Editing of grep buffers, use together with =consult-grep= via =embark-export=.
- [[https://github.com/iyefrat/all-the-icons-completion][all-the-icons-completion]]: Icons for the completion UI.

Note that all packages are independent and can be exchanged with alternative
components, since there exist no hard dependencies. Furthermore it is possible
to get started with only default completion and Consult and add more components
later to the mix. For example you can omit Marginalia if you don't need
annotations. I highly recommend the Embark package, but in order to familiarize
yourself with the other components, you can first start without it - or you could
use with Embark right away and add the other components later on.

* Bug reports
:properties:
:description: How to create reproducible bug reports
:end:

If you find a bug or suspect that there is a problem with Consult, please carry
out the following steps:

1. *Update all the relevant packages to the newest version*.
   This includes Consult, Vertico or other completion UIs, Marginalia, Embark
   and Orderless.
2. Either use the default completion UI or ensure that exactly one of
   =vertico-mode=, =mct-mode=, or =icomplete-mode= is enabled. The unsupported modes
   =ivy-mode=, =helm-mode= and =ido-ubiquitous-mode= must be disabled.
3. Ensure that the =completion-styles= variable is properly configured. Try to set
   =completion-styles= to a list including =substring= or =orderless=.
4. Try to reproduce the issue by starting a bare bone Emacs instance with =emacs -Q=
   on the command line. Execute the following minimal code snippets in the
   scratch buffer. This way we can exclude side effects due to configuration
   settings. If other packages are relevant to reproduce the issue, include them
   in the minimal configuration snippet.

Minimal setup with Vertico for =emacs -Q=:
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(package-initialize)
(require 'consult)
(require 'vertico)
(vertico-mode)
(setq completion-styles '(substring basic))
#+end_src

Minimal setup with the default completion system for =emacs -Q=:
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(package-initialize)
(require 'consult)
(setq completion-styles '(substring basic))
#+end_src

Please provide the necessary important information with your bug report:

- The minimal configuration snippet used to reproduce the issue.
- Your completion UI (Default completion, Vertico, Mct or Icomplete).
- A stack trace in case the bug triggers an exception.
- Your Emacs version, since bugs may be fixed or introduced in newer versions.
- Your operating system, since Emacs behavior varies between Linux, Mac and
  Windows.
- The package manager, e.g., straight.el or package.el, used to install
  the Emacs packages, in order to exclude update issues. Did you install
  Consult as part of the Doom or Spacemacs Emacs distributions?
- Do you use Evil or other packages which apply deep changes?
  Consult does not provide Evil integration out of the box, but there is some
  support in [[https://github.com/emacs-evil/evil-collection][evil-collection]].

When evaluating Consult-related code snippets you should enable [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/elisp/Lexical-Binding.html][lexical binding]].
Consult often relies on lambdas and lexical closures.
