:description: Why Consult?
:end:
#+cindex: introduction

Consult provides various handy commands based on the Emacs completion function
=completing-read=, which allows to quickly select an item from a list of
candidates. Consult offers in particular a more advanced buffer switching
command =consult-buffer= to switch to buffers and recently opened files. Various
search commands are provided, like an asynchronous =consult-grep=, and
=consult-line=, which resembles [[https://github.com/abo-abo/swiper#swiper][Swiper]] or [[https://github.com/emacsorphanage/helm-swoop][Helm-Swoop]]. Multiple of the offered
commands are greatly enhanced in comparison to their existing Emacs equivalents.
The command =consult-imenu= presents a flat list of the Imenu with [[#live-previews][live preview]]
and [[#narrowing-to-subsets][narrowing support]]. Please take a look at the [[#available-commands][full list of commands]]!

All Consult commands are compatible with completion systems based on the
standard Emacs =completing-read= API, notably the default completion system,
[[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Icomplete.html][Icomplete]], [[https://github.com/raxod502/selectrum][Selectrum]] and [[https://github.com/oantolin/embark/][Embark]], with which Consult works out of the box. If
Icomplete is used, it is recommended to install [[https://github.com/oantolin/icomplete-vertical][Icomplete-vertical]]. The
completion system specifics in this package are kept to a minimum. The ability
of the Consult commands to work well with arbitrary completion systems is one
main advantage of the package. This property allows Consult to fit well into
existing setups and it helps you to create a full completion environment out of
small and independent components. Note that, if you use [[https://github.com/abo-abo/swiper#ivy][Ivy]] or [[https://github.com/emacs-helm/helm][Helm]], you
probably don't need Consult, since both packages already bring their own rich
set of additional commands.

There are the [[https://github.com/minad/marginalia/][Marginalia]] and [[https://github.com/oantolin/embark/][Embark]] packages, which can be combined with
Consult. The =marginalia-mode= enriches the completion display with annotations.
The annotations show for example documentation strings or file information. The
versatile Embark packages provides local actions, comparable to a context menu,
which can be executed while selecting a candidate in the minibuffer or in other
contexts. For example, when selecting from a list of files, an action to delete
the file is offered. Embark offers more than local actions and can also be used
as a completion system through its live-updating candidate collect buffer. The
[[#integration-with-embark][Embark integration]] is described later in greater detail.

Alternatively, type =C-h a ^consult= to get an overview of all Consult
variables and functions with their descriptions.

** Virtual Buffers
 :properties:
 :description: Buffers, bookmarks and recent files
 :end:
 #+cindex: virtual buffers

 #+findex: consult-buffer
 #+findex: consult-buffer-other-window
 #+findex: consult-buffer-other-frame
 #+findex: consult-recent-file
 #+findex: consult-recent-file-other-window
 #+findex: consult-recent-file-other-frame
 #+findex: consult-bookmark
 - =consult-buffer= (=-other-window=, =-other-frame=): Enhanced version
   of =switch-to-buffer= with support for virtual buffers. Supports live
   preview and recursive editing while previewing. The command supports
   narrowing. You can type =f SPC= in order to narrow to recent files.
   Ephemeral buffers can be shown by pressing =SPC= - it works the same
   way as =switch-buffer=. Supported narrowing keys:

   - b Buffers
   - f Files
   - m Bookmarks
   - p Project (only available if =consult-project-root-function= is
     configured as shown in the [[#example-configuration][example configuration]])
   - v Views (only available if =consult-view-*-function= is
     configured as shown in the [[#example-configuration][example configuration]])
 - =consult-bookmark=: Select or create bookmark. You might consider the
   powerful =consult-buffer= instead as an alternative, which includes bookmarks.
   However =consult-bookmark= supports preview of bookmarks and narrowing.
 - =consult-recent-file= (=-other-window=, =-other-frame=): Select a
   recent files. You might prefer the more powerful =consult-buffer=
   instead, which includes recent files.

** Editing
 :properties:
 :description: Commands useful for editing
 :end:
 #+cindex: editing

 #+findex: consult-register
 #+findex: consult-yank
 #+findex: consult-kmacro
 - =consult-register=: Select from list of registers. The command
   supports narrowing to register types and preview of marker positions. This
   command is useful to search the register contents. For quick access it is
   recommended to use the built-in Emacs commands like =jump-to-register=. There
   is also the supplementary function =consult-register-preview= which can be
   used as =register-preview-function= for a consistent display. See the [[#example-configuration][example
   configuration]] for how the =consult-register-preview= function is meant to be
   used.
 - =consult-yank=, =consult-yank-pop=: Enhanced version of =yank= and
   =yank-pop= which allows selecting from the kill-ring. Live preview is
   supported when selecting from the kill-ring.
 - =consult-kmacro=: Select macro from the macro ring and execute it.
 - =consult-keep-lines=: Replacement for =keep/flush-lines=
   which uses the current completion style for filtering the buffer. The
   function updates the buffer while typing. In particular, this function can be
   used to further narrow an exported Embark collect buffer with the same
   completion filtering as during =completing-read=. If the input begins with
   "! SPC", the filter matches the complement.
 - =consult-focus-lines=: Temporarily hide lines by filtering them using the current
   completion style. Call with =C-u= prefix argument in order to show the hidden
   lines again. If the input begins with "! SPC", the filter matches the
   complement. In contrast to =consult-keep-lines= this function does not edit
   the buffer.

** Navigation
 :properties:
 :description: Mark rings, outlines and imenu
 :end:
 #+cindex: navigation

 #+findex: consult-goto-line
 #+findex: consult-mark
 #+findex: consult-global-mark
 #+findex: consult-outline
 #+findex: consult-imenu
 #+findex: consult-project-imenu
 - =consult-goto-line=: Jump to line number enhanced with live preview.
   This is a drop-in replacement for =goto-line=.
 - =consult-mark=: Jump to a marker in the =mark-ring=. Supports live
   preview and recursive editing.
 - =consult-global-mark=: Jump to a marker in the =global-mark-ring=.
   Supports live preview and recursive editing.
 - =consult-outline=: Jump to a heading of the outline. Supports live
   preview and recursive editing.
 - =consult-imenu=: Jump to imenu item in the current buffer. Supports
   live preview, recursive editing and narrowing.
 - =consult-project-imenu=: Jump to imenu item in project buffers, with
   the same major mode as the current buffer. Supports live preview,
   recursive editing and narrowing. This feature has been inspired by
   [[https://github.com/vspinu/imenu-anywhere][imenu-anywhere]].

** Search
 :properties:
 :description: Line search, grep and file search
 :end:
 #+cindex: search

 #+findex: consult-line
 #+findex: consult-multi-occur
 #+findex: consult-grep
 #+findex: consult-ripgrep
 #+findex: consult-git-grep
 #+findex: consult-find
 #+findex: consult-locate
 - =consult-line=: Enter search string and select from matching lines.
   Supports live preview and recursive editing. The symbol at point and
   the recent isearch string are added to the "future history" and can be
   accessed by pressing =M-n=.
 - =consult-multi-occur=: Replacement for =multi-occur= which uses
   =completing-read-multiple=.
 - =consult-grep=, =consult-ripgrep=, =consult-git-grep=: Search for
   regular expression in current directory. Grep is invoked
   asynchronously, while you enter the search term. You are required to
   enter at least =consult-async-min-input= characters in order for the
   search to get started. The input string is split into two parts, if
   the first character is a punctuation character, like =#=. For example
   =#grep-regexp#filter-string=, is split at the second =#=. The string
   "grep-regexp" is passed to Grep, the "filter-string" is passed to
   the /fast/ Emacs filtering to further narrow down the list of matches.
   This is particularily useful if you are using an advanced completion
   style like orderless. =consult-grep= supports preview. If
   =consult-project-root-function= is [[#example-configuration][configured]] and the function returns
   non-nil, =consult-grep= searches the current project directory.
   Otherwise the =default-directory= is searched. If =consult-grep= is
   invoked with prefix argument, you can specify the directory manually,
   i.e., =C-u M-g r=.
 - =consult-find=, =consult-locate=: Find file by
   matching the path against a regexp. Like =consult-grep= either the
   project root or the current directory is used as root directory for
   the search. The input string is treated similarly to =consult-grep=,
   where the first part is passed to find, and the second part is used
   for Emacs filtering. Note that =find= uses wildcards, e.g. enter
   =*consult*=, to find all files containing the string "consult". In
   case you want to use another search utility like =fd=, you can write
   wrapper command =my-fdfind= as shown in the [[#example-configuration][example configuration]].

** Compilation errors
 :properties:
 :description: Jumping to compilation errors
 :end:
 #+cindex: compilation errors

#+findex: consult-error
#+findex: consult-flycheck
#+findex: consult-flymake
- =consult-error=: Jump to an error. Supports live preview and recursive
  editing. In contrast to =consult-flycheck= it shows the line and is
  more general since it is not tied to a specific backend.
- =consult-flycheck=: Jump to flycheck error. Supports live preview and
  recursive editing. The command supports narrowing. Press =e SPC=,
  =w SPC=, =i SPC= to only show errors, warnings and infos respectively.
  This command requires to install the additional =consult-flycheck.el=
  package since the main =consult.el= package only depends on Emacs core
  components.
- =consult-flymake=: Jump to Flymake diagnostic, like
  =consult-flycheck=.

** Histories
 :properties:
 :description: Navigating histories
 :end:
 #+cindex: history

 #+findex: consult-complex-command
 #+findex: consult-history
 - =consult-complex-command=: Select a command from the
   =command-history=. This command is a =completing-read= version of
   =repeat-complex-command= and can also be considered a replacement for
   the =command-history= command from chistory.el.
 - =consult-history=: Insert a string from the current buffer history.
   This command can be invoked from the minibuffer. In that case the
   history stored in the =minibuffer-history-variable= is used.
 - =consult-isearch=: During an Isearch session, this command picks a
   search string from history. Outside of Isearch, it reads a string
   from the minibuffer and starts searching; this is useful, for
   instance, as an Embark action. (Note that Isearch does not normally
   read from the minibuffer. What you see at the bottom of the screen
   is the echo area!)

** Major and minor modes
 :properties:
 :description: Toggling minor modes and executing commands
 :end:
 #+cindex: minor mode
 #+cindex: major mode

 #+findex: consult-minor-mode-menu
 #+findex: consult-mode-command
 - =consult-minor-mode-menu=: Enable/disable minor mode. Supports
   narrowing to on/off/local/global modes by pressing =i/o/l/g SPC=
   respectively.
 - =consult-mode-command=: Run a command from the currently active minor
   or major modes. Supports narrowing to local-minor/global-minor/major
   mode via the keys =l/g/m=.

** Miscellaneous
 :properties:
 :description: Various other useful commands
 :end:

 #+findex: consult-apropos
 #+findex: consult-file-externally
 #+findex: consult-completion-in-region
 #+findex: consult-theme
 - =consult-apropos=: Replacement for =apropos= with completion.
 - =consult-man=: Find Unix man page, via Unix =apropos= or =man -k=.
   The selected man page is opened using the Emacs =man= command.
 - =consult-file-externally=: Select a file and open it externally,
   e.g. using =xdg-open= on Linux.
 - =consult-completion-in-region=: Function which can be used as
   =completion-in-region-function=. This way, the minibuffer completion
   UI will be used for =completion-at-point=. This function is
   particularily useful in combination with Icomplete-vertical, since
   Icomplete does not provide its own =completion-in-region-function=. In
   contrast, Selectrum already comes with its own function.
 - =consult-theme=: Select a theme and disable all currently enabled
   themes. Supports live preview of the theme while scrolling through the
   candidates.

* Special features
:properties:
:description: Enhancements over built-in `completing-read'
:end:

 Consult enhances =completing-read= with live previews of candidates, additional
 narrowing capabilities to candidate subsets and asynchronously generated
 candidate lists. This functionality is provided by the internal =consult--read=
 function, which is used by most Consult commands. The =consult--read= function
 is a thin wrapper around =completing-read=. This allows Consult to work with
 different completion systems in the backend, while still offering more advanced
 features.

** Live previews
 :properties:
 :description: Preview the currently selected candidate
 :custom_id: live-previews
 :end:
 #+cindex: preview

 Some Consult commands support live previews. For example when you scroll
 through the items of =consult-line=, the buffer will scroll to the
 corresponding position. It is possible to jump back and forth between the
 minibuffer and the buffer to perform recursive editing while the search is
 ongoing.

 Previews are enabled by default but can be disabled via the
 =consult-preview-key= variable. Furthermore it is possible to specify
 keybindings which trigger the preview manually as shown in the [[#example-configuration][example
 configuration]]. The default setting of =consult-preview-key= is ='any= which
 means that the preview will be triggered on any keypress when the selected
 candidate changes. Each command can be configured individually with its own
 =:preview-key=, such that preview can be manual for some commands, for some
 commands automatic and for some commands completely disabled.

** Narrowing to subsets
 :properties:
 :description: Restricting the completion to a candidate subset
 :custom_id: narrowing-to-subsets
 :end:
 #+cindex: narrowing

 Consult has special support to narrow to candidate subsets. This functionality
 is useful if the list of candidates consists of candidates of multiple types or
 candidates from multiple sources, like the =consult-buffer= command, which
 shows both buffers and recently opened files.

 When you use the =consult-buffer= command, you can press =b SPC= and the list
 of candidates will be restricted such that only buffers are shown. If you press
 =DEL= afterwards, the full candidate list will be shown again. Furthermore a
 narrowing prefix key and a widening key can be configured which can be pressed
 to achieve the same effect, see the configuration variables
 =consult-narrow-key= and =consult-widen-key=.

 If [[https://github.com/justbur/emacs-which-key][which-key]] is installed, the possible narrowing keys are shown in the
 which-key window after pressing the prefix key =consult-narrow-key=.
 Furthermore there is the =consult-narrow-help= command which can be bound to a
 key in the =consult-narrow-map= if this is desired, as shown in the [[#example-configuration][example
 configuration]].

** Asynchronous candidate lists
 :properties:
 :description: Filtering asynchronously generated candidate lists
 :end:
 #+cindex: asynchronous candidates

 Consult has support for asynchronous generation of candidate lists. This
 feature is used for example by =consult-grep=, where the list of matches is
 generated dynamically while the user is typing a grep regular expression. The
 grep process is executed in the background. When modifying the grep regular
 expression, the background process is terminated and a new process is started
 with the modified regular expression.

 The matches, which have been found, can then be narrowed using the installed
 Emacs completion-style. This can be very powerful if you are using for example
 the =orderless= completion style.

 This two-level filtering is possible by splitting the input string. Part of the
 input string is treated as input to grep and part of the input is used for
 filtering. The input string is split at a punctuation character, using a
 similar syntax as Perl regular expressions.

 Examples:

 - =#defun=: Search for "defun" using grep.
 - =#defun#consult=: Search for "defun" using grep, filter with the word
   "consult".
 - =/defun/consult=: It is also possible to use other punctuation
   characters.
 - =#to#=: Force searching for "to" using grep, since the grep pattern
   must be longer than =consult-async-min-input= characters by default.
 - =#defun -- --invert-match#=: Pass argument =--invert-match= to grep.

 For asynchronous processes like =find= and =grep=, the prompt has a small
 indicator showing the process status:

 - =:= the usual prompt colon, before input is provided.
 - =*= with warning face, the process is running.
 - =:= with success face, success, process exited with an error code of zero.
 - =!= with error face, failure, process exited with a nonzero error code.
 - =;= with error face, interrupted, for example if more input is provided.

 There is an ephemeral error log buffer =_*consult-async-stderr*= (note the leading space!),
 you can access the buffer using =consult-buffer= and =switch-to-buffer= by first pressing =SPC=
 and then selecting the buffer.

** Integration with Embark
 :properties:
 :description: Actions, Grep/Occur-buffer export
 :custom_id: integration-with-embark
 :end:
 #+cindex: embark

 *NOTE*: Please install the =embark-consult= package from MELPA, which provides
 Consult-specific Embark actions and the Occur buffer export.

 Embark is a versatile package which offers context dependent actions,
 comparable to a context menu. See the [[https://github.com/oantolin/embark][Embark manual]] for an extensive
 description of its capabilities.

 Actions are commands which can operate on the currently selected candidate (or
 target in Embark terminology). When completing files, for example the
 =delete-file= command is offered. Embark also allows to to execute arbitrary
 commands on the currently selected candidate via =M-x=.

 Furthermore Embark provides the =embark-collect-snapshot= command, which
 collects candidates and presents them in an Embark collect buffer, where
 further actions can be applied to them. A related feature is the
 =embark-export= command, which allows to export candidate lists to a buffer of
 a special type. For example in the case of file completion, a Dired buffer is
 opened.

 In the context of Consult, particularily exciting is the possibility to export
 the matching lines from =consult-line=, =consult-outline=, =consult-mark= and
 =consult-global-mark=. The matching lines are exported to an Occur buffer where
 they can be edited via the =occur-edit-mode= (press key =e=). Similarily,
 Embark supports exporting the matches found by =consult-grep=,
 =consult-ripgrep= and =consult-git-grep= to a Grep buffer, where the matches
 across files can be edited, if the [[https://github.com/mhayashi1120/Emacs-wgrep][wgrep]] package is installed.

* Configuration
:properties:
:description: Example configuration and customization variables
:end:
#+cindex: installation

Consult can be installed from [[https://melpa.org/][MELPA]] via the Emacs built-in package manager.
Alternatively it can be directly installed from the development repository via
other non-standard package managers.

It is recommended to manage package configurations with the excellent
=use-package= macro. The Consult package only provides commands and does not add
any keybindings or modes. In order to use the Consult commands, you must
configure the keybindings yourself. As a result, the package is not intrusive
but requires a little setup effort. Feel free to only bind the commands you
consider useful to your workflow!

Note that there are two packages as of now: =consult= and =consult-flycheck=.
=consult-flycheck= is a separate package such that the core =consult= package
only depends on Emacs core components. The =consult= package will work out of
the box with the default completion, Icomplete and Selectrum.

** Fine-tuning of individual commands
 :properties:
 :alt_title: Fine-tuning
 :description: Fine-grained configuration for special requirements
 :end:
 #+cindex: configuration

 *NOTE:* Consult allows fine-grained customization of individual commands. This
 configuration feature is made available for experienced users with special
 requirements.

 Commands allow flexible, individual customization by setting the
 =consult-config= list. You can override any option passed to the internal
 =consult--read= API. Note that since =consult--read= is part of the internal
 API, options could be removed, replaced or renamed at any time.

 Useful options are:
 - =:preview-key= set the preview key, default is =consult-preview-key=
 - =:initial= set the initial input
 - =:default= set the default value
 - =:history= set the history variable symbol
 - =:add-history= add items to the future history, for example symbol at point
 - =:sort= enable or disable sorting

 #+begin_src emacs-lisp
 ;; Set preview for `consult-buffer' to key `M-p'
 ;; and disable preview for `consult-theme' completely.
 ;; For `consult-line' specify multiple keybindings.
 ;; Note that you should bind the <S-up> and <S-down> in the
 ;; `minibuffer-local-completion-map' or `selectrum-minibuffer-map'
 ;; to the commands which select the previous or next candidate!
 (setq consult-config `((consult-theme :preview-key nil)
                        (consult-buffer :preview-key ,(kbd "M-p"))
                        (consult-line :preview-key (list ,(kbd "<S-down>") ,(kbd "<S-up>")))))
 #+end_src

 Generally it is possible to modify commands for your individual needs by the
 following techniques:

 1. Create your own wrapper function which passes modified arguments to the Consult functions.
 2. Modify =consult-config= in order to change the =consult--read= settings.
 3. Create advices to modify some internal behavior.
 4. Write or propose a patch!

* Recommended packages
:properties:
:description: Related packages recommended for installation
:end:

It is recommended to install the following package combination:

- consult: This package
- consult-flycheck: Provides the consult-flycheck command
- [[https://github.com/raxod502/selectrum][selectrum]] or [[https://github.com/oantolin/icomplete-vertical][icomplete-vertical]]: Vertical completion systems
- [[https://github.com/minad/marginalia][marginalia]]: Annotations for the completion candidates
- [[https://github.com/oantolin/embark][embark and embark-consult]]: Action commands, which can act on the completion candidates
- [[https://github.com/oantolin/orderless][orderless]]: Completion style, Flexible candidate filtering
- [[https://github.com/raxod502/prescient.el][prescient]]: Frecency-based candidate sorting, also offers filtering

Additional recommended packages for wider integration:

- [[https://github.com/justbur/emacs-which-key][which-key]]: Helpful mode showing keybindings, also shows the Consult narrowing keys
- [[https://github.com/mhayashi1120/Emacs-wgrep][wgrep]]: Editing of grep buffers, can be used together with =consult-grep= via Embark

Note that all packages are independent and can potentially be exchanged
with alternative components, since there exist no hard dependencies.
Furthermore it is possible to get started with only Selectrum and
Consult and add more components later to the mix.

:description: Contributors and Sources of Inspiration
:end:

You probably guessed from the name that this package took inspiration from
[[https://github.com/abo-abo/swiper#counsel][Counsel]] by Oleh Krehel. Some of the Consult commands originated in the [[https://github.com/raxod502/selectrum/wiki/Useful-Commands][Selectrum
wiki]]. The commands have been rewritten and greatly enhanced in comparison to the
wiki versions. In particular all Selectrum-specific code has been removed, such
that the commands are compatible with the =completing-read= API.

Consult is intended to be a community effort, please participate in the
discussions. Contributions are very welcome. If you have a proposal, take a look
at the [[https://github.com/minad/consult/issues/6][Consult wishlist]].
