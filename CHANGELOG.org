* Development

- Bugfixes
- Add =consult--source-file-register=, and make the registers available in
  =consult-buffer=. Registers are often used as quick access keys for files, e.g.,
  =(add-to-list 'register-alist '(?i file . "~/.emacs.d/init.el")))=.
- Remove obsolete =consult-line-point-placement=
- =consult-grep/find=: Always show directory in the prompt
- Add variable =consult-yank-rotate=, =consult-yank-from-kill-ring= rotates kill ring
- Emacs 29: =consult-register= supports =buffer= register type
- Emacs 29: Support =outline-search-function=
- Org 9.6: Support new =org-fold-core= API (both overlays and text-properties)

* Version 0.20 (2022-10-16)

- Bugfixes
- Allow =consult-*-args= to be a string, or a list of strings or expressions.
- Introduce face =consult-highlight-match= to highlight grep matches in the
  completion buffer.
- Highlight full matches in =consult-line=, =consult-outline=, =consult-*grep= and
  =consult-flymake=.
- Remove face =consult-preview-error=.
- Deprecate =consult-line-point-placement= in favor of more general
  =consult-point-placement=, which is also used by the =consult-*grep= commands.
- =consult-imenu=: Support imenu-after-jump-hook and non-default
  =imenu-default-goto-function=
- =consult-history=: Add support for history index variables, which are updated
  after selection.
- Deprecate support for Selectrum in favor of Vertico. If you use Selectrum
  consider switching to Vertico, Icomplete, Mct or default completion.

* Version 0.19 (2022-09-09)

- Bugfixes
- Allow =consult-flymake= to work across all buffers in a project
- Remove deprecated =consult-completing-read-multiple=
- =consult-grep/git-grep/ripgrep=: Add =--fixed-strings= support
- =consult-grep=: Respect =grep-find-ignored-directories/files=
- =consult-org-heading=: Add tags to completion candidates
- Add =consult-preview-excluded-files=
- =consult-themes=: Support regexps

* Version 0.18 (2022-05-25)

- Bugfixes
- Removed obsolete =consult-recent-file-filter= and =consult-preview-excluded-hooks=
- Deprecate =consult-completing-read-multiple=. See #567 for details.
- Add =consult--source-modified-buffer=

* Version 0.17 (2022-04-22)

- Bugfixes
- Drop Emacs 26 support.
- =consult-goto-line=: Use =goto-line-history= on Emacs 28.
- =consult-customize=: Evaluate settings at runtime. This change makes it possible
  to use =thing-at-point= to overwrite the =:initial= and =:add-history= settings.
- Rename =consult--read-config= to =consult--customize-alist= and change the format.
  The configuration is an alist. The car must be a command symbol. The cdr must
  be a plist of keys and expressions, where the expressions evaluate to the
  actual configuration values.
- Mode hooks in previewed file buffers are delayed. The buffer is only fully
  initialized when leaving the minibuffer for recursive editing.
- Increase =consult-preview-raw-size=.
- Replace =consult-preview-excluded-hooks= by =consult-preview-allowed-hooks=.
- Add =consult-preview-variables= to bind variables for file preview.
- BREAKING API CHANGE of =consult--read=, =consult--prompt=, =consult--multi=: The
  state function protocol changed. The function gets notified of more completion
  state changes. See the docstring of =consult--with-preview= for details.
- BREAKING API CHANGE of =consult--read=: The lookup function protocol changed.
  The function must now accept four or more arguments.
- Remove unused =consult-preview-map=.
- Remove unnecessary =consult-recent-file-filter=. Use =recentf-exclude= instead.
- =consult--multi= sources can have a =:new= function to create candidates.
  When narrowed to a source, new candidates will be created by calling the
  respective =:new= function.
- =consult--multi= returns =:match= information. =:match= can be nil, t, or new,
  depending on if the candidate does not exist, exists or has been created.
- =consult-locate= treats the input literally to take advantage of the db index.

* Version 0.16 (2022-03-08)

- Bugfixes
- Deprecate =consult-project-root-function= in favor of =consult-project-function=.
- Preconfigure =consult-project-function= with a default function based
  on project.el.
- Add =consult-project-buffer=, a variant of =consult-buffer= restricted to the
  current project.
- Add =consult-register-prefix= option.
- Introduced a generic and extensible =consult-register= implementation.
- Lazy marker creation in =consult-line/outline= (performance improvements)

* Version 0.15 (2022-01-31)

- Bugfixes
- =consult-xref=: Prettify the group titles, use =xref--group-name-for-display=
  if available.
- =consult-focus-lines=: Thanks to @jdtsmith, the command is much faster and
  actually useable in large files.
- Added Mct integration, auto refreshing of asynchronous Consult commands.

* Version 0.14 (2021-12-31)

- Bugfixes
- Add =consult-recent-file-filter=
- Rename =consult--source-(project-)file= to =consult-source-(project-)recent-file=
- =consult-keep-lines= makes read-only buffers temporarily writable if confirmed

* Version 0.13 (2021-11-12)

- Bugfixes
- =consult-register=: Add support for file register values.
- Rename =consult-isearch= to =consult-isearch-history=. The command is a history
  browsing command and not a replacement for Isearch.
- =consult-grep= support -[ABC] grep options
- Add =consult-grep-context= face

* Version 0.12 (2021-10-11)

- Bugfixes
- Removed obsolete =consult-project-imenu= and =consult-x-command= variables
- =consult-grep=: Use ~--null~ argument to support file names with colons

* Version 0.11 (2021-08-18)

- Bugfixes only

* Version 0.10 (2021-08-11)

- =consult-mark=, =consult-global-mark=: Add optional marker list argument
- =consult-completing-read-multiple=: New function
- Rename =consult-project-imenu= to =consult-imenu-multi=
- Add =consult-line-multi= to search multiple buffers
- Removed obsolete =consult-yank=, =consult-async-default-split=, =consult-config=
- =consult-ripgrep=: Use =--smart-case=
- =consult-grep/git-grep=: Use =--ignore-case=
- Deprecate =consult-<cmd>-command= in favor of =consult-<cmd>-config.=
- =consult-find=: Use regular expressions instead of globbing/wildcards by default.
  Due to the changes to =consult-find= it is not possible anymore to configure
  =fd= as backend for =consult-find=. A replacement is documented in the wiki.
- =consult-find/locate/man=: Add highlighting to the matching file/man page names.
- =consult-grep/git-grep/ripgrep/find/locate=: Add support for multiple unordered
  patterns. Each of the input patterns must be matched. For example,
  =consult-find= transforms the input "first second third" to "first -and second
  -and third".
- =consult-grep/git-grep/ripgrep=: Compute the highlighting based on the input,
  instead of relying on the ANSI-escaped output. This works better with multiple
  patterns, but may occasionally produce false highlighting.
- Deprecate =consult-x-command= configuration variables in favor of =consult-x-args=.
  The variables have been renamed since the configuration format changed.
- =consult-async-split-styles-alist=: Remove the =space= splitting style, since
  it has been obsoleted by the support for multiple unordered patterns.

  This enables support for the =basic= completion style and TAB completion.
- =consult--read=: The =:title= function must accept two arguments now,
  the candidate string and a flag. If the flag is nil, the function should
  return the title of the candidate, otherwise the function should return the
  transformed candidate.

- =consult-find/grep=: Ensure that the commands work with Tramp
- =consult-outline=: Add narrowing
- Added =consult-org-heading= and =consult-org-agenda=
